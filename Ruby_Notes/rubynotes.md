Programming Notes On Ruby


<!-- 
#puts will create a new line

#prints prints will not create a new line      -->





<!-- puts "Hello World"
# its going to ignore this line
#when putting a hash tag in front of the line its called comment     -->


 <!-- In Ruby when you put a hashtag (#) in front it will make the current line a commment -->
 <!-- Also when using hashtags its great to use when decribing what you are doing or what does the line of code suppose to do explanation and such. This provides a way to break down the code so people can understand your code. -->
